# Project Overview 
## Project Name
Pacmen Cloner üëª
## Project Link

## Project Description
In this project, a PacMen game includes creating wall-bouncing Pacmens with a click of a button. The Pacmen are are coded in an array as well as copies of the Pacmen code and images in the DOM, which is a useful technique in large virtual codes used in React. To play the game, press "start game" after creating your desired number of pacmen and change their speeds by clicking the same button multiple times. *No actual ghost in the game*
## Project Setup on Your Machine
To get this code to work on your machine, clone the repository in your IDE terminal by copying the HTTPS link from the green code button on the repo page. 
## Project Improvement Opportunities
In this game, each Pacmen can move at different speeds by clicking the ‚Äústart game‚Äù button and look forward to updating the Pacmen to change colors gradiently. I also want to add ghost.
